# Data Structures

Course 2 of 6 in the [Data Structures and Algorithms Specialization](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/data-structures-algorithms)

## About this course
In this course, we consider the common data structures that are used in various computational problems. You will learn how these data structures are implemented in different programming languages and will practice implementing them in our programming assignments. This will help you to understand what is going on inside a particular built-in implementation of a data structure and what to expect from it. You will also learn typical use cases for these data structures.
